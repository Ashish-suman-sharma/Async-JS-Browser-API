The same-origin policy is a security rule that browsers use to keep your data safe. It basically says, "Your web page
can only request data from the same site it came from." This means your page can’t just pull data from any website out
there unless the other site says it’s okay.

How to Work Around It:
1 .CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): If the server you want data from is set up for it, it can allow your page to 
access its data by adding special headers.
2. JSONP (JSON with Padding): This is an older method that lets you load data by adding a script tag to your page, but it only works for GET requests.
3. Proxy Server: You can send your request to your own server first, and then have your server forward it to the other site.
4. SameSite Cookies: Sometimes, cookies can be set to control what data is shared across different sites.
