The XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object is like a tool in JavaScript that allows your web page to communicate with a
server in the background. This means your page can request data or send data without having to reload the whole
page, which is what makes web pages feel more interactive and faster.

Used in AJAX:
1 .You start by creating an XMLHttpRequest object.
2 .Then, you "open" a connection to the server, telling it what kind of request you're making (like GET or POST)
and where to send it.
3 .After that, you "send" the request off to the server.
4 .When the server responds, you handle that response by checking if everything went smoothly
(the request was successful) and then doing something with the data, like updating the page content.
