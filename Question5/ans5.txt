DOM API (Document Object Model):

This is what you use to interact with the HTML on a page. For example, you can use it to find elements (getElementById), change 
their content, or add new elements to the page.
Fetch API:

This is a modern way to make network requests. It’s simpler and cleaner than the old XMLHttpRequest and returns a Promise, which
 makes it easier to work with.

 



Geolocation API:

This API lets you find out where the user is located, which you can use for things like maps or location-based services.
Canvas API:

This one lets you draw things on a web page, like graphics, charts, or even games, using the <canvas> element and JavaScript.
Web Storage API:

This includes localStorage and sessionStorage, which let you store data in the browser that stays around even when the user 
navigates away from the page (localStorage) or just while they have the page open (sessionStorage).





Web Workers API:

This lets you run scripts in the background, so your main web page doesn’t get slow or stuck when doing big tasks.
Notifications API:

This lets your web app send notifications to the user, even when they’re not actively looking at your app.
Service Workers API:

This is key for making your web app work offline or load faster by caching resources. It’s a big part of what makes 
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) possible.
