localStorage:
localStorage is like a little storage box in the browser where you can save data that stays there even after the user
closes their browser. It’s great for things like saving user settings or keeping track of whether someone is logged in.
Example:

localStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');
var username = localStorage.getItem('username');
console.log(username);
localStorage.removeItem('username');


sessionStorage:
sessionStorage is similar, but the data only sticks around while the page is open. Once the user closes the 
tab or browser, the data is gone. It’s useful for things like temporarily storing form data.
Example:

sessionStorage.setItem('sessionId', 'abc123');
var sessionId = sessionStorage.getItem('sessionId');
console.log(sessionId);
sessionStorage.removeItem('sessionId');

When to Use Which:
Use localStorage when you need the data to stick around even after the user leaves your site, like keeping track of user preferences.
Use sessionStorage for temporary data that only needs to last while the user is on the site, like keeping track of what step they’re on in a form.
